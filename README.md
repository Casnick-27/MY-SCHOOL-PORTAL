# BETTER TOMORROW School Website

A clean, responsive school website for **BETTER TOMORROW**. The homepage includes a front hero image, school values, academic programs, student life, admissions steps, events, and a contact form.

## Project Files

- `index.html` - Main website page and content.
- `styles.css` - Layout, colors, responsive design, and visual styling.
- `app.js` - Mobile menu, scroll animations, rotating hero quote, active navigation, and contact form feedback.
- `server.js` - Optional local static server.
- `assets/` - Website images, including the front classroom background image.
- `data/enrollments.json` - Submitted enrollment registrations when the local server is running.

## Open the Website

You can open `index.html` directly in a browser.

## Run With the Local Server

If Node.js is available, run:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Customization

- Replace school contact details in `index.html`.
- Edit colors and spacing in `styles.css`.
- Update the rotating hero quotes in `app.js`.
- Add or replace images in the `assets/` folder.

## Enrollment Form

The Apply Now button scrolls to the enrollment form. The form collects details for Visit, Apply, Assess, and Enrollment. If you run the website with `node server.js`, submitted registrations are saved in `data/enrollments.json`. If the website is opened directly as an HTML file, registrations are saved in the visitor's browser storage instead.
